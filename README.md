# Hack++
A project to port my first game, Hack+, to C++, adding features that were not previously possible in perl.

## Installation

### Requirements

* SDL2 >= 2.0.8
* cmake >= 2.8

## Compiling
Compiling Hack++ is as simple as the following:

```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
```

**Note for windows users: You may have to manually select a generator for cmake! e.g.:**
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" CMakeLists.txt

```
